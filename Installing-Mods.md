IF YOU USE MODS PLEASE FOLLOW THESE VERY SIMPLE RULES
1. If you encounter a bug PLEASE try and disabling mods, to do so drag winhttp.dll out to your desktop or somewhere else, from here try and reproduce the issue, if you still encounter the issue report it to the devs, if it only happens with mods then try going to the support channel of the modding discord!
